    # ensure that the property of the source has actually been changed
    When I can catch the following groups in one line of the registered string "GenericT_0_logs" and store them as registered strings
      | #(\d+) - add_source/GenericS/0/GenericS_.+ |
      | GenericT_0_addSource_GenericS_opIdx |
    And I expand the string "${registry_url}/get_env_log.php?idx=${GenericT_0_addSource_GenericS_opIdx}" and store it as "GenericT_0_addSource_GenericS_env_url" in the context
    And I call the URL which is defined in registered string "GenericT_0_addSource_GenericS_env_url" with path "" and fetch the response and store it in the context as "GenericT_0_addSource_GenericS_env"
    Then the following expanded regex should be found in the registered string "GenericT_0_addSource_GenericS_env"
