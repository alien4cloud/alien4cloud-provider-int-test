  Scenario: Scaling default 1 then 2,1,3,1 for A and B

   Given I am authenticated with "ADMIN" role

     And I create a new application with name "test-lifecycle-1" and description "Test lifecycle with CFY 3" based on the template with name "demo-lifecycle"

  Scenario: Should be able to read injected properties as input

    Given I am authenticated with "ADMIN" role

    And I create a new application with name "test-lifecycle-3" and description "Test lifecycle with CFY" based on the template with name "demo-lifecycle"
    And I Set a unique location policy to "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location" for all nodes
    And I set the following inputs properties
      | os_arch | x86_64 |
      | os_type | linux  |

    When I deploy it
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And The application's deployment must succeed after 15 minutes
    And The URL which is defined in attribute "url" of the node "Registry" should work
    And I store the attribute "url" of the node "Registry" as registered string "registry_url"

    When I call the URL which is defined in registered string "registry_url" with path "/get_instance_log.php?node=GenericA&idx=0" and fetch the response and store it in the context as "GenericA_0_log"

    Then the following expanded regex should be found in the registered string "GenericA_0_post_configure_source_GenericB_0_env"
      | ^SOURCE_generic_property=default_value$ |
    Then the following expanded regex should be found in the registered string "GenericA_0_post_configure_source_GenericB_0_env"
