    And I create a new application with name "block-storage-cfy3" and description "Block Storage with CFY 3" based on the template with name "block_storage"
    And I Set a unique location policy to "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location" for all nodes

    When I deploy it
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And The application's deployment must succeed after 15 minutes
    Then I should have a volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "CBS1" for "block-storage-cfy3"
    Then I should have a volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "CBS2" for "block-storage-cfy3"
    Then I should have a volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "CBS3" for "block-storage-cfy3"
    Then I should have a volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "CBS4" for "block-storage-cfy3"

    When I upload the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt" to the node "Compute"'s remote path "/var/cbs1/block_storage_test_file.txt" with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    When I upload the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt" to the node "Compute"'s remote path "/var/cbs2/block_storage_test_file.txt" with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    When I upload the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt" to the node "Compute"'s remote path "/var/cbs3/block_storage_test_file.txt" with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    When I upload the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt" to the node "Compute"'s remote path "/var/cbs4/block_storage_test_file.txt" with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"

    And I re-deploy the application
    Then The application's deployment must succeed after 15 minutes

    When I download the remote file "/var/cbs1/block_storage_test_file.txt" from the node "Compute" with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    Then The downloaded file should have the same content as the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt"
    When I download the remote file "/var/cbs2/block_storage_test_file.txt" from the node "Compute" with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    Then The downloaded file should have the same content as the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt"
    When I download the remote file "/var/cbs3/block_storage_test_file.txt" from the node "Compute" with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    Then The downloaded file should have the same content as the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt"
    When I download the remote file "/var/cbs4/block_storage_test_file.txt" from the node "Compute" with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    Then The downloaded file should have the same content as the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt"
    When I undeploy it
    Then I should have a volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "CBS1" for "block-storage-cfy3"
    Then I should have a volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "CBS2" for "block-storage-cfy3"
    Then I should have a volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "CBS3" for "block-storage-cfy3"
    Then I should have a volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "CBS4" for "block-storage-cfy3"
    Then I delete the volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "CBS1" for "block-storage-cfy3"
    Then I delete the volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "CBS2" for "block-storage-cfy3"
