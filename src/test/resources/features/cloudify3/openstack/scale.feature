    And I create a resource of type "alien.nodes.openstack.Flavor" named "Small" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And I update the property "id" to "2" for the resource named "Small" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And I create a resource of type "alien.nodes.openstack.Image" named "Ubuntu" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And I update the property "id" to "02ddfcbb-9534-44d7-974d-5cfd36dfbcab" for the resource named "Ubuntu" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And I autogenerate the on-demand resources for the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And I update the property "user" to "ubuntu" for the resource named "Small_Ubuntu" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    And I create a resource of type "alien.nodes.openstack.PublicNetwork" named "Internet" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"

    And I update the property "size" to "1 gib" for the resource named "SmallBlock" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"

    # Application
    And I create a new application with name "scale_with_storage" and description "Scale with storage" based on the template with name "scale_storage"
    And I Set a unique location policy to "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location" for all nodes
    When I deploy it
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And The application's deployment must succeed after 15 minutes
    And I wait for 30 seconds before continuing the test
    And I should have a volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "BlockStorage" for "scale_with_storage"
    And I should have a volume on OpenStack with id defined in property "volume_id" of the node "BlockStorage3" for "scale_with_storage"

    # Scale
    When I scale up the node "Compute" by adding 1 instance(s)
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And The node "Compute" should contain 2 instance(s) after at maximum 15 minutes
    When I wait for 30 seconds before continuing the test
    And I should have volumes on OpenStack with ids defined in property "volume_id" of the node "BlockStorage" for "scale_with_storage"

    # upload data
    When I upload the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt" to the node "Compute" instance 0 remote path "/mnt/test/block_storage_test_file.txt" with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    When I upload the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt" to the node "Compute" instance 1 remote path "/mnt/test/block_storage_test_file.txt" with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    When I undeploy it
    And I wait for 31 seconds before continuing the test
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    # change default instances and redeploy
    Given I update the node template "Compute"'s capability "scalable" of type "tosca.capabilities.Scalable"'s property "default_instances" to "2"
    When I deploy it
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And The application's deployment must succeed after 15 minutes

    # check that the volumes have been reused
    When I download the remote file "/mnt/test/block_storage_test_file.txt" from the node "Compute" instance 0 with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    Then The downloaded file should have the same content as the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt"
    When I download the remote file "/mnt/test/block_storage_test_file.txt" from the node "Compute" instance 1 with the keypair "keys/openstack/alien.pem" and user "ubuntu"
    Then The downloaded file should have the same content as the local file "data/block_storage_test_file.txt"
    When I undeploy it
    Then I should have volumes on OpenStack with ids defined in property "volume_id" of the node "BlockStorage" for "scale_with_storage"
    Then I should have volumes on OpenStack with ids defined in property "volume_id" of the node "BlockStorage3" for "scale_with_storage"
    And I delete volumes on OpenStack with ids defined in property "volume_id" of the node "BlockStorage" for "scale_with_storage"
    And I delete volumes on OpenStack with ids defined in property "volume_id" of the node "BlockStorage3" for "scale_with_storage"
