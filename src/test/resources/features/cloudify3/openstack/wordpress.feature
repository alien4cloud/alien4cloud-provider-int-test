    And I Set a unique location policy to "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location" for all nodes
    And I update the node template "mysql"'s property "storage_path" to "/var/mysql"
    And I add a relationship of type "tosca.relationships.AttachTo" defined in archive "tosca-normative-types" version "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT" with source "DbStorage" and target "computeDb" for requirement "attachment" of type "tosca.capabilities.Attachment" and target capability "attach"

    When I substitute on the current application the node "internet" with the location resource "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"/"Internet"
    When I substitute on the current application the node "privateNetwork" with the location resource "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"/"PrivateNetwork"
    And I set the following inputs properties
      | os_arch | x86_64 |
      | os_type | linux  |

    When I deploy it
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And The application's deployment must succeed after 15 minutes
